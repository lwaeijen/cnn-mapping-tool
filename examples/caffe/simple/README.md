Trained caffe models usually are emitted in binary form (.caffemodel)
For debugging the simple network presented here was handwritten, and as such the "trained weights" are given in prototxt format (human readable)
The makefile provided here converts the prototxt to binary caffemodel, which is what the framework expects for the weights
